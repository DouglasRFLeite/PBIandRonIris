### Iris Dashboard built with Power BI and R as exercise during Data Science Academy's Power BI course.

These are the script and Dashboard I`ve built during the twelfth chapter of [Data Science Academy's Power BI Course](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course?courseid=microsoft-power-bi-para-data-science) as a case study. For more information on it check my Medium post [Power BI and R on Iris Dataset](https://medium.com/@douglas.rochedo/power-bi-and-r-on-iris-dataset-c3e7c82693ec).

PS: Data Science Acadamy is a Brazilian course given in Portuguese, thus, all of the content provided by the course is in Portuguese. All content in English is made by me and I shall not translate everything to English. So, if you want to understand better what I have done here, it is best you check the Medium post than try to understand from the content available here.
